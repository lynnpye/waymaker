waymaker
=============
waymaker is a small bridge between two mods:
- [Waystones](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/waystones)
- [Xaeros' Minimap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-minimap)

## Usage
Install the mod normally. Obviously it requires the two aforementioned mods to also be installed along 
with their dependencies.

## Configuration
There is only waymaker-client.toml to configure.

### Target Custom Waypoint Set : boolean : false
If true, will attempt to save new waystone waypoints to the custom waypoint set defined below. If false, new waypoints
will simply be saved to the currently chosen waypoint set.

### Custom Waypoint Set : string : "Waystones"
The custom waypoint set to save new waystone waypoints to. Only used if 'Target Custom Waypoint Set'
is true.

## Why This Mod?
There exists a mod, [Waystones2Waypoints (w2w)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/waystones2waypoints), but
it hasn't been updated for 1.18.2.

If built-in support for Waystone waypoint updates becomes available, this mod would no longer be needed. In the meantime,
here it is.

## Permissions
Feel free to use my mod in your modpack. Please let me know if you do, as it's nice to hear from folks.
